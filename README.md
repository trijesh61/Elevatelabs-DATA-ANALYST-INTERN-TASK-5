# 🚢 Titanic Dataset 

This repository contains a complete exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to extract meaningful insights and patterns related to survival rates using Python and data visualization tools.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is from the [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).  
Main file used: `train.csv`

## 📌 Objectives

- Handle missing data appropriately
- Understand distribution of numerical features
- Analyze relationships between survival and features like age, gender, class
- Visualize correlations between variables
- Summarize actionable insights

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Steps

1. Import and explore the data
2. Handle missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked)
3. Visualize distributions with histograms
4. Analyze categorical features using countplots
5. Create boxplots for survival comparison
6. Generate correlation heatmap and pairplots
7. Draw final insights and observations

## 📈 Visuals & Plots

- Age and Fare distributions
- Survival counts by gender and class
- Correlation heatmap
- Pairplot of survival-related variables

## 📊 Summary of Insights

- 🎯 Most survivors were from 1st class and were female
- 📉 3rd class and male passengers had lower survival chances
- 💸 Higher fare is loosely associated with better survival
- 🧒 Age had mild correlation with survival — many children survived

## 🧠 Interview Prep

- What is EDA?
- What is the use of pairplots and heatmaps?
- How do you handle missing values?
- What is the difference between univariate and bivariate analysis?
